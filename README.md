The reason I chose this topic is because I have very strong beliefs about the security of the nation. In class we talked about Edward Snowden and whether what he did was the "Right" thing to do. In this story, you go through a short adventure of Edward Snowden finding out about the mass surveillance program by the United States. You get to peer into what he could have been thinking in the moments and days leading up to his stealing and leaking of the information. Then the fun begins, attempting to flee the country. A big portion of the class was focused on security and if Edward Snowden's leak was the right thing to do. I think this story dives into the implications of why he did so.
